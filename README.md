# FTSE 100 Mean-Reversion & Cointegration Research

This repository contains a quantitative research project analysing whether selected FTSE 100 equity pairs exhibit statistically meaningful mean-reversion behaviour suitable for a simple market-neutral trading strategy. The study was completed as part of independent quant research work aimed at developing practical experience with statistical modelling, backtesting, and Python-based financial analysis.

## 📘 Overview

The project investigates:
- Cointegration relationships between highly liquid FTSE 100 stocks  
- Construction of stationary spreads using Engle–Granger methodology  
- Z-score–based mean-reversion trading signals  
- Backtesting of a long/short market-neutral strategy  
- Evaluation of performance through Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and cumulative PnL  

Full methodology, figures, and interpretations are documented in the accompanying PDF report.
