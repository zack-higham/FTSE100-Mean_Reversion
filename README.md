# FTSE 100 Mean-Reversion & Cointegration Research

This repository contains a quantitative research project analysing whether selected FTSE 100 equity pairs exhibit statistically meaningful mean-reversion behaviour suitable for a simple market-neutral trading strategy. The study was completed as part of independent quant research work aimed at developing practical experience with statistical modelling, backtesting, and Python-based financial analysis.
